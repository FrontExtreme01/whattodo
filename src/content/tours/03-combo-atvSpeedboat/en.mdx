    <TagP> Experience Cancun's top adventure activities with this value combo featuring ATV riding & ziplining in the jungle, swimming in a scenic cenote, and speedboating & snorkeling at the Nizuc Reef. The ATV Jungle tour starts with a convenient pickup from your hotel or a nearby meeting point. Head out to the wilderness and the dense Yucatan jungle, just off the famous Ruta de los Cenotes. The adventure kicks off with a 30-minute ATV ride through muddy, dusty and bumpy roads. Continue with an exciting flight on a 3-zipline circuit before cooling off in an exotic cenote in the middle of the jungle. Embark on an exciting expedition, steering your speedboat through the Nichupte Lagoon and out to the Caribbean. Snorkel on the scenic Nizuc Reef and get a glimpse of the fascinating exhibits of the famous Underwater Museum of Art. </TagP>
