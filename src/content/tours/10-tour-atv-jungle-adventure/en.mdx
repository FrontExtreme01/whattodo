    title: 'Great Day'
    review: 'The representative of the hotel told us about extreme adventure eco park and suggested it was a good option for a half day tour in Cancun. He was absolutely right! The tour is about 4 hrs plus the transportation time from our hotel, which it wasnt far as we thought. We did muddy ATV’s, Fly on the zip lines and swam on the beautiufl cenote. Our guide Aldo was incredible and make us feel very special and laughing all the time. If you visit make sure you ask for him. Thank you for a great day!'

    title: 'Saving my sneakers'
    review: 'For a moment I thought that I would ruin my new sneakers, since the tulum atv route will be muddy, however, they made the comment to prevent me, so I could buy other cheap water shoes so that I would not dirty my tennis shoes. Thank you very much to the very attentive and always friendly guides.'

    title: 'Nice weather'
    review: 'We were not sure about buying a package to visit this Cancun eco-park, since i am afraid of the heights and dont like bugs, but i sincerily say it was a good choice! The weather was incredible and allow us to swim in a beautiful cenote, zipline, and do the ATVs which i loved since it was my first time riding an atv. The guide made sure i was safe all the time and made us laugh alot. I will for sure be back on my next visit to cancun.'
