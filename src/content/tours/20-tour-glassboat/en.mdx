    <TagH2>About the Glass Boat Tour</TagH2>

    <TagP>Enjoy the adventure of the <strong>Glass Bottom Boat</strong>, sail through the Nichupté Lagoon and the <strong>Caribbean Sea</strong> in such a transparent boat, a unique experience with incredible 360-degree visibility. Its hull is completely transparent. However, it will be an exciting <strong>tourist trip in Cancun</strong>, where you will be able to appreciate the secrets of the seabed without getting off the boat.</TagP>

    <TagH3>Begin the adventure</TagH3>

    <TagP>Then start with a short drive <strong>around the lagoon</strong>, home to many <strong>birds and crocodiles</strong>. Next, sail out to the open sea, where the color of the water changes to a <strong>stunning turquoise blue</strong>. Keep your eyes peeled for tropical fish, starfish, and <strong>colorful coral</strong>. With better luck, you might even see some rays and sea turtles.</TagP>

    <TagP><strong>Adults on board can enjoy a beer or two, courtesy of the ship’s captain.</strong></TagP>

    <TagP><strong>Duration: 1.15 Hours</strong></TagP>
